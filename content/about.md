Hi. I'm Robert Uhnari. My real name is generic and boring so I chose Uhnari as a penname, hoping it'll really grab reader's attention.

On top of being a freelance writer working on my debut novel, I'm also a digital nomad. I've been doing Workaway for months and stayed in places all across America, hopefully by now I'm backpacking across Europe, so if you need someone to help with random projects, chores, farmwork, etc—in exchange for room and board—hit me up, I never know where I'm going next so maybe I'll be in your area.
