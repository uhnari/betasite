### [Chapter 1]({{< ref "aech1" >}}) < Chapter 2 > [Chapter 3]({{<ref "aech3">}})

Rachel decides to sketch out a rough story board on her tablet. She can’t seriously commit to the animation until she writes out the script, of course, but _just_ focusing on that has been holding her up for weeks. So she’ll draw out the basic story she wants to tell, and let that guide the script. Once she knows what she’s going to say, she’ll revise and finalize the animations and recordings.

&ensp;One panel at a time to start. With her heavy black digital art stylus in one hand, and holding her tablet in place with the other, she looks to her large computer monitor as her ideas take shape.

&ensp;

Rachel remembers a huge brown coffee table. She was pressing her little stomach against it and leaning over some markers and construction paper. Her mom’s warm hand covering her shoulder like a blanket from behind; heavy, giving a strong loving squeeze. Her other slender hand was pointing down at the paper.

&ensp;According to her mother, she was teaching Rachel how to draw, but; “Good _job_! I’m _so proud of you_!” were the only words she could remember. Mom wasn’t wearing perfume that day, the two of them were sweaty from all the spring cleaning and Mom wanted a break.

&ensp;They didn’t get back to cleaning that day. The house smelt of sunshine, dessert sand, and bleach.

&ensp;Mom and Dad once showed her over video chat — on her first assignment away from home — the scrapbook where they still had every single scrap and scribble she ever drew as a kid.

&ensp;

Summer was almost over. Rachel would be a sophmore in a month. She came home from tennis that day and went straight to finishing the work she started that morning. She flipped through this week’s drawings again and again. None of them looked better than when she left. Nothing was salvagable. All these weeks of work were a waste.

&ensp;She ripped out the drawings, crumpling them and letting them drop to the floor. The rest of her failures from the previous months were all colored over with ink or scratched out with pencil from all the times she’s restarted this project.

&ensp;She tore through her room, pulling out her old scrapbooks — even her school notebooks for the doodles in there. She needed _something_. Something to put in her porfolio, something for inspiration.

&ensp;Anything. Anything to prove she wasn’t a failure. Anything to show she at least had the _potential_ to go to college and become an animator.

&ensp;Anything to prove she was good enough.

&ensp;A knot of pain grew in Rachel’s chest. Like a bone shifting and pressing up against her heart. No matter how much her chest heaved, Rachel couldn’t get enough air into her lungs.

&ensp;Rachel layed down on the floor before she started getting dizzy. Pressing her back to the hardwood, she held one hand in the other and lifted her arms back behind her head to open up her chest and worked on maintaining slow, deep, steady breathing — ignoring the feeling of not getting enough oxygen — fingers and hairs brushing up against balls of paper and blacked out sketches…

&ensp;After a while of staring up at the ceiling, the knot in her chest eased and Rachel could breath again.

&ensp;This wasn’t going to work. She couldn’t do it. She could never make art her career. She couldn’t waste her parents money on something so stupid.

&ensp;As Rachel thought of the conversation she’d have to have with Mom and Dad when they got home — the disapointment in thier eyes — hot, salty tears stung and she covered her face with her arm, letting her sleeve absorb the tears.

&ensp;

When all was said and done, there was a short storyboard of little manequin drawings acting out her memories across sparse backgrounds and rough sketches of props.

&ensp;She pulls up a fresh slide, stylus trembling over the screen. Rachel wasn’t even halfway through. It got so much worse throughout high school and college, and that was before the meteors fell. But she needs to show these things.

&ensp;It took a while, but her parents eventually talked her into continuing as an artist. Aassuring her she had what it took to be an animator for one of the big companies. Rachel knew she was a fraud, but they believed in her. Her brother too. In the darkest parts of her life, she _always_ had her family.

&ensp;She can’t put in any details to trace back to her, but her family would know this was from her. They watched every one of her videos when she was an animator; they know her art style. Combined with these events, there would be no doubt in their minds.

&ensp;But who else would care? How could _this_ go viral? If she makes it more entertaining, more digestible, something audiences would actually _want_ to share, it might go over her family’s head. If it’s full of things vague enough to be anyone, they would scroll past it, dismissing the art-style alone as just another copycat. This had to get personal.

&ensp;If Rachel does both, it would be too long, her message buried in the fluff. No one would share it or watch the whole way through. She needs to break containment. She needs her message to spread out of the underground and reach the legal networks, too, so she can’t put anything that won’t circulate on those networks, nothing to catch the attention of corporate regulation, and nothing that’d make people hesitate to share it under big brother’s watchful eye.

&ensp;If Rachel had a platform, like in the old days, she could put out multiple videos linking back to a channel, so if her family came across a single viral video, they could follow it back to the real one. But those days are long gone. Audiences are small, and any non-corporate platforms are either built for small scale anonymity and secrecy, or destroyed.

&ensp;Exhausted from her internal debate, Rachel drops a fist to the table and leans back in her chair, scratching the back of her head. She looks down at her tablet, a blank digital art canvas covering the screen, still fresh from where she left off.

&ensp;Rachel looks around the room, illuminated by the blue light of her monitor and the glaring sunlight streaming in from the windows. She swears she just heard something, or _felt_ something. She looks out the window and sees the streetlight still flickering. That wasn’t it.

&ensp;Dead quiet, no birds, no wind. Rachel turns back to the monitor. The clock reads just past eleven thirty.

&ensp;The water bottle on her desk shakes, ring-like ripples dancing across the surface of the water.

&ensp;Rachel stares down at the bottle with wide eyes.

&ensp;The water jumps again. Her eyes narrow and her jaw hardens. Regular intervals. No mistake.

&ensp;_They found me._

&ensp;Rachel bites down the shot of adrenaline flooding through her mouth and chest. She rises and forces the heavy stylus into her pocket with trembling, damp hands.

&ensp;She calms herself by taking a breath and the time to gauge the distance of the enemy, estimating sizes, numbers.

&ensp;The entire water bottle jumps this time. Another thump sends one of her hand-held gaming devices to the floor with a crack. By the third, the floor vibrates under the worn rubber soles of her shoes.

&ensp;Single source of noise. Closing fast. Less than twenty seconds. Has to be huge. Like light artillery shells slowly walking up to the house, only it’s too fast. Every collision spaced roughly two seconds apart. There’s only one thing that fits that description.

&ensp;_First you drive me away, now you send_ this _thing to force me back?_

&ensp;More devices thrown from the shelf, an enlarged framed picture of her children bounces violently against the wall — hugging the wall by the power of thick wires and thicker staples — as Rachel marches across the room and dons her dark purple hoodie hanging from the hook on the door.

&ensp;_‘Promise me you’ll always wear it.’_ Her daughter’s voice sounds in her ear.

&ensp;It’s been over a year since Rachel designed the jacket with her team, her _family_. Months since she’s been able to wear it out in the open. Her team’s insignia — the geometric silhouette of a bird — dominates the back; and a stylized R, marking the jacket as hers, at the breast. The silhouette was supposed to be a phoenix, after her team’s codename, but it’s vague enough to be any bird, really.

&ensp;After sliding on the jacket and flipping her hair out from under it, Rachel notices her hands stop shaking.

&ensp;_Feels good to wear it again._

&ensp;If only her legs would play along and stop shaking. Rachel takes the heavy stylus out of her pocket and flips the switch. She spins its familiar weight around in her hand as it charges up — vibrant pink energy swirling at the tip — as she plays with the idea this really is some kind of new light artillery and she should _really_ just run out of the house.

&ensp;_No, if it’s what I’m thinking, then I’m surrounded. Leaving the house is suicide._

&ensp;They wouldn’t send it in alone. There has to be a team of mercs out there, waiting on the order to break down the door and take her in. Her own son wouldn’t put her in any serious danger. This was _just_ a show of force. Best sit tight and see what’s what.

&ensp;The house throws itself into one final shock as the stylus’s tranformation reaches a cresendo, illuminating the room in its pink glow, casting Rachel’s warped and monstrous shadow across the floor. She swings it out as the transformation completes, stylus replaced by a dark curved sword in the afterglow of the ethereal light. The rubber coated handle warm in her hands.

&ensp;The black metal blade still gleams pink and white where the light hits it.

&ensp;Dead quiet.

&ensp;Soon replaced by the whirs and whines of a machine outside the window. The rending of plywood and dry wall rip through the floor as something climbs up the side of the house.

&ensp;Her damn legs won’t stop shaking.

&ensp;_Come on..._

&ensp;Hands tighten around her sword as black talons rip into the walls and floor and a large matte black metal head peers through the front window. Rachel’s heart jumps despite her protest.
&ensp;
&ensp;A single, souless, red eye peers through the glass plane. Rachel can make out the enlarged pixels on the display, reminding her when she put a magnifying glass to her old TV as a kid.

&ensp;_That’s not right. Red signals lethal tasks. The eyes should be blue or yellow._

&ensp;A familiar pink glow rises from the bottom corner of the window, coloring the dark metal head and the glossy red eyes like a sunset.

&ensp;A bright blue arch burns up through the hardwood floor, sending the smell of smoking wood and hot copper throughout the room. Rachel steps aside as it races across, feeling the heat radiate up her shins, stomach, and through her hoodie as it straightens into a beam searing through the back wall.

&ensp;_Fuck that._ Rachel turns and jumps out the back window, curling into a ball and tucking her face into her arms, still gripping her sword tight.

&ensp;The neon blue plasma explodes under her side, infused with pink electricity, blowing out the window and back wall with the deafening crack of a wrecking ball.

&ensp;_This thing’s here to kill me._

&ensp;Glass and debris surround her. The air bakes hotter as she the plasma stream rises up to meet her. Rachel’s lungs fill with burning copper and suddenly the heat wanes as it travels up the side of her face.

&ensp;She uncovers her face to find the ground coming up fast. Rachel takes the landing hard on the balls of her feet, slamming her shoulder down into a tuck and roll and spins around to face her unwelcome guest climbing down from the house:

&ensp;Humanoid. More than twice her height. Aether infused black-purple talons for hands and feet, similar to the metal of her sword. Same for the cables for its arms, legs, and waist. Blue-steel armor thrown over top of the torso.

&ensp;Matte-black metal head, small bird-like beak, and red eyes almost entirely obscured behind an off-white bow protruding from its chest like the bow of a ship.

&ensp;_Made in his own image. That little brat._

&ensp;She saw them showcasing these titans on the net last month. Generic, plain steel versions.

[Now that i’m not bound by the Jaiden Convention, i could make these legit bird-bots that fight like dinos or something. It would make for a much more dynamic fight. Save idea for later maybe.]

&ensp;The mountain of metal leaps forward, thrusting a spear-like claw at her. Rachel sidesteps and vaults onto the arm, jumping off as it swings its arm back.

&ensp;_Its reactions aren’t instantaneous, closer to human than computer._

&ensp;Rachel comes in with sword overhead. The Arisbot snags the blade with it’s taloned hand and clamps down on the katana, as if trying to snap it. It gives up and instead yanks the sword, by extension her, to the side; sending out sparks and ozone as the talons scrape across the blade.

&ensp;Rachel backs away as it stabs out again and again. It doesn’t pursue.

&ensp;Instead, it quickly and mechanically removes its chest bow, wielding it like a shield, and trades its talon for a large iron ball on the end of a thick cylinder. The talon now sitting on its exposed chest like a piece of ornamental armor.
&ensp;
&ensp;Rachel catches her breath and stays light on her feet as she watches. By the time she puts together what’s happening, it’s done.

&ensp;Four shining metal winglets flourish from its back, each twice the length of her blade, and four times the width. A parody of the wings on her team’s insignia.

&ensp;It raises the mace over its head.

&ensp;_Oh shit._ Rachel turns tail and leaps out of reach.

&ensp;A chest-splitting shock spits out rock and dirt just behind her. She looks back to see the ball half-buried in broken earth, a chain running back to the titan’s arm.

&ensp;Too close.

&ensp;A second mech descends on a roaring jet several meters behind the first. Dust and exhaust choke the baking breeze. [And it was just silent on it’s way over here?]

&ensp;Like the first, but green with a red chest bow, and two massive tanks on its back.

&ensp;_Talia._

&ensp;The Talibot lands, and thrusts open its own chest, revealing a multi-chambered rocket launcher. They ignite one after the other, scattering in all directions. Moving more like flares.

&ensp;_Shit._ Rachel pumps her legs as the smart-rockets bear down on her. Most fall short, shaking the ground and sending shock waves slapping into her back. Nothing more than giant concussion grenades made to break up protests, programmed to avoid people directly, instead hitting the ground between protesters.

&ensp;The video she saw did nothing to prepare Rachel for the shock waves slamming into her one after the other from every side. Convulsing her insides and ripping away any sense of balance or sanity. Everything smells of burning fireworks, scorched earth, and searing copper.

&ensp;Ears ringing, Rachel turns to see a red-tipped rocket coming straight for her out of the clouds of earthen dust and acrid smoke.

&ensp;Reflex takes over as she steps aside and cuts the rocket out of the air, closing her eyes as it burns close. The blade passes through with little effort. Acrid fumes assault her face as the two halves of the rocket fall and skid harmlessly across the ground.

&ensp;_A dud? I refuse to belive I’m that lucky. That was meant to kill._

&ensp;If they wanted her dead, a single conventional rocket would do. Too fast to dodge, lethal payload, and the shrapnel could get her easy. Why use slow ass smart-rockets? Why go through the trouble of reprogramming one to run her through?

&ensp;The Talibot barrels out of the dust and smoke like the rocket she just cleaved. Bright steel blades sprouting from the arms by its sides. Rachel leans forward, raising her sword and standing her ground. The Talibot kicks upright and brings its blades down on her as it lands.

&ensp;Her blades bite into the inferior metal, locking them in a bind. If only the robot put its weight into it, she could have cut the blades clean through.

&ensp;Rachel has a sudden image in her head of the mech struggling to get up, like a turtle that’s been turned over. Could their extra armor and ornaments make them top heavy? Is that why they don’t bear their full weight?

&ensp;Lungs thick with dust and jet fumes. Blades bearing down on her. Sweating. Panting. Arms shaking. She doesn’t know how much longer she can keep this up.

&ensp;The ground shakes as a blue blur falls from the sky, landing in front of the house. Rachel steals a glance to see the Arisbot, shield replaced on its chest, blue and pink jet forming at its beak.

&ensp;Rachel jumps back as the jet erupts in full force, leaving Talibot to take the heat for this one.

&ensp;A deafening explosion erupts as shrapnel and burning metal scatter from a pillar of fire and acrid black smoke where Talibot once stood, now a burning corpse on her front lawn.

&ensp;All while she circles around and closes the distance on the Arisbot.

&ensp;_Time to end this._

&ensp;She’s got an idea, but she needs a little time. Rachel throws her whole body into drop-kicking a taloned foot out from under the hulking beast. It falls to its hands and takes a knee as she clambers to the top of the padded boulder.

&ensp;By the time she reaches the top, the Arisbot is looking up at her, still on one knee. Rachel leaps from the boulder, bringing her sword back as she descends onto the Aribot, another pink spark igniting at its beak.

&ensp;_I only have one shot._

&ensp;She swings her sword, feeling only slight resistance. Her vision flashes black as the mech’s arm clotheslines her. The ground comes up from behind and knocks the air from her lungs, bouncing her brain off the inner walls of her skull, and jarring the sword from her grip.

&ensp;Rachel rolls several times and stumbles to her feet. Head swimming through watered vision. The world lurches sideways and she widens her stance to keep upright.

&ensp;The Arisbot stays in the kneeling position, venting pinks sparks and hot gas where its head should be. Then keels over, internal humming, whirs, and whining fall dead as it hits the ground with the sound of someone wailing on a dumpster full of car parts. Its head still rolling around on the ground, hateful red eyes dull to glossy black.

&ensp;With the killer robots made in the image of her children dealt with, Rachel drags herself up to the house, chest heaving.

&ensp;Her legs turn back to rubber, and she presses her back against the front door and collapses to catch her breath, listening past the blood pounding in her ears and scanning the trees for more enemies.
